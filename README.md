# Kenya's Agricultural Production (1960-2022) Analysis

## üöú **Project Overview**

This repository contains the analysis of a fascinating dataset on **Kenya's Agricultural Production**, covering the years **1960 to 2022**. The dataset, available on Kaggle, provides comprehensive insights into the production of various crops and livestock products in Kenya. It includes valuable information on the volume of production by year, item, and region.

This analysis focuses on understanding the agricultural production trends in Kenya, identifying shifts over time, and visualizing these trends using data analysis and visualization tools.

## üìä **Key Insights**
- **Time Span**: The dataset spans over 60 years, offering a historical perspective on agricultural production in Kenya.
- **Diverse Data**: It includes data on both crops (e.g., Abaca) and livestock products, with production volumes in tonnes.
- **Estimated and Actual Data**: The dataset includes both estimated and actual production values, making it useful for trend analysis.
- **Granular Data**: It provides data by **Item** (such as Abaca, maize, etc.), **Year**, and **Region (Kenya)**.

## üîç **What Was Done**
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Loaded the dataset and performed initial exploration to understand its structure.
   - Cleaned and pre-processed data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Analyzed agricultural production trends across different decades.
   - Investigated shifts in production levels and identified patterns of growth or decline.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualized key insights using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
   - Created plots such as line graphs, bar charts, and heatmaps to better understand trends.

## üí° **Why It Matters**
Understanding agricultural production trends is essential for:
- **Policy Makers**: Helping to shape policies around food security, sustainability, and economic development.
- **Agribusinesses**: Providing insights on crop and livestock production that can drive investment and business decisions.
- **Farmers**: Informing decisions on crop choices and production planning based on historical trends.

By analyzing this data, we can gain a deeper understanding of Kenya‚Äôs agricultural landscape, including the growth or decline of specific products and their impact on the country‚Äôs economy.

## üõ† **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization and plotting.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive exploration and analysis.
